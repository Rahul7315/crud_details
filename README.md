## React CRUD Operations with Local JSON Server

This repository demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using React.js and a local JSON server (`db.json`). 

### Features
- Create new data entries
- Read and display data from the `db.json` server
- Update existing data
- Delete data entries

### Technologies Used
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- JSON Server: A full fake REST API server implemented with JSON

### Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the JSON server: `npm run server`
4. Start the React application: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

### JSON Server
The local JSON server (`db.json`) acts as a mock backend, providing a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations. You can modify the `db.json` file to add, update, or delete data entries as needed.

### File Structure
- `src/components`: Contains React components used in the application
- `src/services`: Contains API services for interacting with the JSON server
- `src/App.js`: Main component that handles the CRUD operations
- `src/App.css`: Stylesheet for the application
